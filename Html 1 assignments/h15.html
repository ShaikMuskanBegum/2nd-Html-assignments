     <p>Mother is a very special and important for every child.Precious Gift of god.Mother is a symbol of
        love,honesty,truth,parent,guide,everything.My mother is an inspiration for me. She is an amazing woman. She is
        the woman I admire the most. I start my day with my mothersmile. She is the first one to wake up every
        morning, every single day. She starts her day at five in the morning by taking our pet for a walk. She then
        wakes my brother and me and prepares us for school. She takes care of our lunch boxes with different menus every
        day. She drops us at the bus stop. Her waving hand gives us assurance that she is always there for us no matter
        what. She helps us with our studies and assignments. My mother is the one to spend sleepless nights when we fall
        sick. She is always very concerned about our education, health, and happiness. She defines our character every
        moment. She also compromises her needs and ensures that our needs are taken care of first. She always guides us
        to do the right things in life and choose the right direction. She does everything possible to make us feel
        comfortable all the time. She is our best friend. We can share all our secrets with her and whenever we are in
        jeopardy, we know that our mother would give us some solution. Many times, she becomes a child herself and
        enjoys to the fullest with us like going out for movies, shopping and playing ludo, cards, etc.
        My mother not only takes care of us but also takes care of our father and grandparents. She is the pillar of
        strength for our father. She is the one who creates strong bonds among all our relatives. She is always on her
        toes catering to all needs and requirements of my grandparents. She has never stepped back whenever our
        neighbors and friends approached her for help.Mother is emotion for me.Mother is my weakness.I miss my ammi
        alot.without ammi the life is a hell.Mother be a friend for a daughter and strength.when i loose my ammi i lost
        my life.The days are countable days with depressed life.I MISS YOU AMMI JAAN.....</p>
