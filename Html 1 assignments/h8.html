        that loads fast & is also light weighted. Whenever you use your browser to contact a server, you will receive a
        response in the form of HTML and CSS. Many tags are supported by HTML, making your web page more appealing and
        recognizable. HTML5 has recently incorporated new tags and elements to aid in the development of
        professional-looking web pages.</p>
